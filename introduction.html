        <p>I’m a junior studying computer science with a concentration in AI, robotics, and gaming.
            I transferred from WCU for the fall semester and have so far been enjoying my time here at UNCC.
            I enjoy hiking, playing violin and mandolin, and playing video games in my free time.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Personal Background: </b>I grew up in Louisiana and moved to Asheville, NC about
                four years ago. I'm pursuing a degree in computer science because I enjoy problb solving
                and the challenge of figuring things out.</li>
            <li><b>Professional Background: </b>I have yet to work a role in the software industry,
                however I have taught coding classes for the company I work for.</li>
            <li><b>Acadbic Background: </b>I started pursuing computer science at WCU, and
                decided that UNCC would be a better fit for me.</li>
            <li><b>Primary work computer & location</b>I use an Asus G14 laptop as my "desktop"
                at home, and dual boot Windows 11 and EndeavourOS on it.</li>
            <li><b>Backup work computer & location: </b>I carry an M2 Macbook air with me to class
                because it has a much better battery life than my g14 and is able to handle most of the tasks
                I need it to while on campus.</li>
            <li><b>Current courses:</b>
                <ol>
