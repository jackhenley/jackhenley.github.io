          <li>
            Contrast: This site manages contrast exceptionally well. The site
            offers both a light and dark mode, both of which are pleasant on the
            eyes. In light mode, sections use light grey for the background,
            which is more pleasant than the solid white background for reading.
            In dark mode, sections use a dark grey background, which makes text
            more readable than if it were on the solid black background.
          </li>
          <li>
            Repetition: Once again, I feel that this site utilizes repetition
            very well. Each definition gets its own section, which includes
            pronunciations, a descriptive definition, and links to sources. As
            mentioned before, sections are also given a slightly different
            background than the main backgroun of the webpage, which helps
            distinguish between different sections.
          </li>
          <li>
            Alignment: As mentioned in the previous item, sections are easily
            distinguised because each definition gets its own background. This
            site also utilizes very light borders around each definition to
            further distinguish elements.
          </li>
          <li>
            Proximity: Different elements are easily distinguishable due to the
            style of the site. Furthermore, related items are grouped together
            within the different sections. Whitespace is used effectively to
            definitively separate unrelated items.
          </li>
        </ul>

        >
        <ul>
          <li>
            Contrast: This site uses a plain white background wtih dark blue
            colored text. White the use of dark blue over black might be
            slightly easier on the eyes, it is nonetheless very unpleasant to
            view.
          </li>
          <li>
            Repetition: The main content of this site is links directing to news
            and information regarding the company. The links are contained in an
            unordered list, so each one is associated with a bullet point. I
            would consider this design to be pretty unremarkable.
          </li>
          <li>
            Alignment: The sections of the site itself are separated by
            horizontal rules. Although this is a simple way to do so, it does
            work adequately.
          </li>
          <li>
            Proximity: While the separation between distinct sections on this
            site is adequate, the separation between distinct elements in the
            same section is virtually nonexistent aside from whitespace in
            between different elements.
