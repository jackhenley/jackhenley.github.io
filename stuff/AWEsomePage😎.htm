      The GR Corolla is a high-performance version of the extremely well-known
      Toyota Corolla. Although you might assume that since the names are
      similar, the cars must be similar also, this is not the case. The GR
      Corolla is more similar to its rally ancestors than it is to its modern
      day counterparts.

      is the greatest modern hot hatchback available today. Not only is it a
      very capable sports car for a variety of motorsports, but because it's a
      four-door hatchback, it is also practical. Owning a GR Corolla means that
      after you're done running errands and driving to work during the week, you
      can push your limits at a track day on the weekend. Or if you prefer to
      take it back to its roots, you can find a

      your skills as a rally driver.
